Don't be afraid of reading papers with mathematics!
    Are you sick of papers that mention a bunch of mathematical theorems you have never heard of and searching for them?
    Or figuring out what on this ridiculous mathematical world is going on?

    Leave the 'searching for mathematical this and that' part on me. Now you only have to google for other less boring stuffs! We dive together into papers and crack all the boring mathematical parts.

By the way, the notes are not free from typos and grammatical errors!
