# Paper-reviews
Don't be afraid of reading papers with mathematics!  
Are you sick of papers that mention a bunch of mathematical theorems you have never heard of and searching for them?  
Or figuring out what on this ridiculous mathematical world is going on?   
Don't worry!  
Leave the 'searching for mathematical this and that' part on me. Now you only have to google for other less boring stuffs!  
We dive together into papers and crack all the boring mathematical parts.  

In the description of each review, I have written a short summary of the paper ,I think, in a pretty humorous manner.  
It will be definitely fun to check this out! I guarantee!  

By the way, the notes are not free from typos and grammatical errors.  
So please report me if you find them :)   

Furthermore, I will be also very happy on any feedback on the reviews!  
So feel free to contact me and give a feedback :). 

Have a nice day!
